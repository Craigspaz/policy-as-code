This workshop will help developers and security practitioners become familiar with implementing policy as code. Participants can explore these tools in more details below:

* [AWS Cloudformation Guard](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard).
* [Open Policy Agent/Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#rego)

AWS Cloudformation Guard is a open source project, supported by the AWS Cloudformation services team, designed to check AWS CF templates for policy compliance using a simple declaritive syntax. Open Policy Agent is a general purpose policy engine that uses a policy language called Rego to express polices. Participants can use the workshop to explore each of these tools or focus on one of them.
