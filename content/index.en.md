Policy as code can help organizations better manage their risks in the cloud while reducing the friction that often accompanies the deployment of compliant and secure workloads. This workshop explores how to codify a set of rules that make up a policy and use a DevSecOps workflow to quickly address and redeploy a demo workload. We will demonstrate this workflow using a CI/CD pipeline. Finally we will also implement these rules in AWS Config to detect and notify operations when resources are not compliant.
