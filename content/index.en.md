Policy as code can help organizations better manage their risks in the cloud while reducing the friction that often accompanies the deployment of compliant and secure workloads. This workshop explores how to codify a set of rules that make up a policy, use a DevSecOps workflow to quickly address policy issues, and redeploy a policy compliant workload. Detective controls will also be explored with the same codified rules used for the DevSecOps workflow. These rules will be implemented as custom AWS Config rules to detect and notify operations when resources are not compliant.
