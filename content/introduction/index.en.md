Policy as code shifts policy reviews before a single AWS resource is deployed, giving developers immediate feedback on what needs to be done to deploy compliant workloads. It also notifies and alerts operations when a resource is no longer compliant after they are deployed. The result of implementing policy as code is faster business value of a given workload that complies with governance and security policies, helping organizations manage their risks in the cloud. This workshop explores how to codify a set of rules that make up a policy. These rules will be used to validate infrastructure as code (IaC), flagging the code when there is a rule violation and allowing a DevOps workflow to quickly address and redeploy the workload. We will demonstrate this workflow using a CI/CD pipeline that will illustrate aspects of this workflow. Finally we will also implement these rules in AWS Config to detect and notify operations when resources are not compliant.
