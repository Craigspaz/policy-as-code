Developer, operation, and security teams can become familiar with implementing policy as code by understanding the tools designed for defining rules/policies. Projects like [cfn-guard](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard) and [Open Policy Agent/Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#rego) offer high-level languages that can ease the development of rules. Other projects like [checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov), [cfn_nag](https://github.com/stelligent/cfn_nag), and [cfn-lint](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-lint) offer pre-defined rules. Both types of projects are necessary to craft a complete set of rules that cover standard best practices as well as organization specific policies. This workshop was developed to explore these projects.
