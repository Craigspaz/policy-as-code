AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with 
just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential tools for 
popular programming languages, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), docker CLI, git and much more pre-installed so 
you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your laptop for this workshop. This workshop requires use of *nix environment 
since it uses bash scripts as part of the labs. Cloud9 runs on an Amazon EC2 instance with Amazon Linux 2 by default. 
Your Cloud9 environment will have access to the same AWS resources as the user with which you logged into the AWS 
Management Console.

### Setup the Cloud9 Development Environment

- Go to the AWS Management Console, search for cloud9 in search box and then select **Cloud9**.

- Once ready, your IDE will open to a `Welcome` tab and `AWS Toolkit -Quick Start` tab. The central panel of the IDE has two parts:  a text/code editor in the upper half, and a terminal window in the lower half. Below the welcome screen in the editor, you should see a terminal prompt similar to the following (you may need to scroll down below the welcome screen to see it):

When it comes up, customize the environment by closing the welcome and other tabs by clicking the **x** symbol in each tab. 
To create a new text/code file, just click the **+** symbol in the tabs section of the editor part of the IDE.

- Closing the **Welcome tab** and **AWS Toolkit -Quick Start**
